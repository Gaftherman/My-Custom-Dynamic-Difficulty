## What is new/changed in this script?

- üõ†The skills now are reading from store/DDX-Matrix.txt
    > Reason: An easier way to edit enemy skills.

- üõ†The DDX-Maplist.txt now works in reverse. With this I mean that the maps that you put here will be where the DD doesn't work (it will take the default skill of SC)
    > Reason: It's preferable to make a BlackList instead of a WhiteList in my opinion.

- üí°I added a timer to see how much time has passed on the map.
    - To modificate this, put in the console ".admin_timer_mode 0-2"
    - ‚ö†Ô∏è Just admins can modificate this.

    Mode 0: Deactivate the timer.
