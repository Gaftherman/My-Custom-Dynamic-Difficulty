# My-Custom-Dynamic-Difficulty
> Based on Cubemath's Dynamic Difficulty0~10.

## Installation Guide

[Download this repository](https://github.com/Gaftherman/My-Custom-Dynamic-Difficulty/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) and extract it's contents inside `Steam\steamapps\common\Sven Co-op\svencoop\`

That should look like this:

```
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ üìÅsvencoop
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ üìÅscripts
     ¬†¬† ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ üìÅplugins
            ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ üìÅGaftherman
            ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ üìÑDynamicDifficulty.as
            ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ üìÅstore
                ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ üìÑDDX-Banned.txt
                ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ üìÑDDX-Maplist.txt
                ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ üìÑDDX-Matrix.txt        
```

Now, in the default_plugins.txt. 

> In the case you don't know where is the default_plugins.txt x[
```
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ üìÅsvencoop
     ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ üìÑdefault_plugins.txt
```

Add this
```
"plugin"
{
	"name" "Dynamic Difficulty"
	"script" "Gaftherman/DynamicDifficulty"
} 
```

And there is, you installed the my Dynamic Difficulty. üéâüéâüéâüéâüéâüéâ

## What is new/changed in this script?

- üõ†The skills now are reading from store/DDX-Matrix.txt
    > Reason: An easier way to add/edit enemy skills.

- üõ†The DDX-Maplist.txt now works in reverse. With this I mean that the maps that you put here will be where the DD doesn't work (it will take the default skill of SC)
    > Reason: It's preferable to make a BlackList instead of a WhiteList in my opinion.

- üí°I added a timer to see how much time has passed on the map.
    - ‚ö†Ô∏èJust admins can modificate this. 
    - ‚ö†Ô∏èTo modificate this, put in the console `.admin_timer_mode 0-2`.
    ```
    Mode 0: Deactivate the timer.
    ```

    ```
    Mode 1: In this mode the time is going to show like ( Timer: Hours : Minutes : Seconds )
    ```
    ![](https://i.imgur.com/brOfebH.png)
    ```
    Mode 2: In this mode the timer will be progressive.
    ```

 - üí°I added a way to change the velocity of the enemies depending of the difficult. It's like a multiplier. 
    - ‚ö†Ô∏èPutting a multiplier too high may not work.
 
    ```angelscript
    /***********************/
    /* Monster speed array */
    /***********************/
    private array<double> MonsterSpeedMultiplier =
    {
        1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.3, 1.6
    };
    ```
  - üí°I added a way to barnacle eat more fast depending of the difficult. 
     - ‚ö†Ô∏èPutting a value too high may not work.
     ```angelscript
     /****************************/
     /* Barnacle speed eat array */
     /****************************/
     private array<double> BarnacleEatSpeed =
     {
        8.0, 8.0, 8.0, 8.0, 8.0, 12.0, 16.0, 24.0
     };
     ```
    
  - üí°I added a way to vote for the player to change the difficulty on-the-fly.
    - ‚ö†Ô∏èThere is a delay of 15 seconds between vote. To avoid spam.
    - ‚ö†Ô∏èIf the player vote more than 8 times, He will not be able to vote for 80 seconds.
    - ‚ö†Ô∏èYou can add the SteamID of the people that you don't want to vote in the DDX-Banned.txt.
    
    `In the console:`
    ```
    .diff [number] - All players
    .admin_diff [number] - Only admins. This will change the difficulty without vote
    ```
    `In the chat:`
    ```
    /vote diff [number] - All players
    /votediff [number] - All player
    ```
    
  - üí°I added a way clamp the difficulty.
    - ‚ö†Ô∏èYou need to be admin to change this.
    - ‚ö†Ô∏èThey will not be able to vote under the minimum difficulty.
    - ‚ö†Ô∏èThey will not be able to vote above the maximun difficulty.
    - ‚ö†Ô∏èThis will be permanent. And restart will not change this.
    
    `To clamp the difficulty:`
    ```
    .admin_clamp_diff [min number] [max number]
    ```
    `To disable the clamped difficulty`
    ```
    .admin_clamp_diff -1 -1
    ```

## Reported issues
```
Angelscript: Not allowed: in section 'c:/program files (x86)/steam/steamapps/common/sven co-op/svencoop_addon/scripts/plugins/DynamicDifficulty.as', at (859, 21):
Angelscript: Function Angelscript: SKValue:
Angelscript: Message: Index out of bounds
ERROR: Angelscript: CASBaseCallable::Call: Execution of function '::MapActivate' failed!
```

## Future Ideas

In the DDX-Maplist.txt add a way to specific the difficulty to the map, the velocity of the enemies and the barnacle eat.

Like:
```
hl_05_a1 <- This will disabled the difficulty in this maps.
hl_05_a1 99 <- This will put the difficulty in 99% regardless of the difficulty.
hl_05_a1 99 1.5 <- This will put the difficulty in 99% regardless of the difficulty with the monster velocity multiplier in 1.5.
hl_05_a1 99 1.5 9 <- This will put the difficulty in 99% regardless of the difficulty with the monster velocity multiplier in 1.5 and the barnacle eat velocity in 9 unities per frame to eat.
```
